The dev-haskell/process package is being masked for removal. Going
forward, the 'process' Haskell package will be exclusively provided by
dev-lang/ghc. There have been recent revision bumps to all GHC versions
which do not provide the new version of 'process' by default. However,
users may run into trouble with removing dev-haskell/process from the
system and running subsequent rebuilds.

*Note!* Do not follow these instructions until you have upgraded to one
of the following GHC versions:

- dev-lang/ghc-8.10.6-r3
- dev-lang/ghc-8.10.7-r2
- dev-lang/ghc-9.0.2-r4
- dev-lang/ghc-9.2.4-r1
- dev-lang/ghc-9.2.5
- dev-lang/ghc-9.2.6

To remove dev-haskell/process from the system it will likely be
necessary to forcibly remove it and clean up with the following:

    emerge --rage-clean dev-haskell/process \
        && haskell-updater -- @preserved-rebuild \
        && emerge @preserved-rebuild

Note that the --rage-clean option for emerge is generally unsafe, but
in this case it needs to be done to unstick things and allow
haskell-updater to rebuild the broken packages.
