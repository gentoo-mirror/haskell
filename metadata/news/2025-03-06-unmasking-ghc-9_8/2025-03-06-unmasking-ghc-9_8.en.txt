The v9.8 branch of dev-lang/ghc is now unmasked as it is considered
stable enough for general use on this repo. If you wish to stay on an
earlier version, you may use the new files located in the
scripts/package.mask/ directory of the repo (only ghc-9.4 and ghc-9.6
are provided). To use them, simply add a symlink of the desired file
to your /etc/portage/package.mask/ directory.

For instance, to stay on ghc-9.4, run the following:

    ln -s $(portageq get_repo_path / haskell)/scripts/package.mask/ghc-9.4 \
        /etc/portage/package.mask/ghc-9.4

As always, report any bugs to the gentoo-haskell bug tracker[1].
